Introduction/Business Problem
The problem we are trying to address is of car accidents in Seattle city. Accidents happen at all times, but if the main causes of accidents are determined, advance warning or mitigating methods can be performed. For example, certain intersections may be more susceptible to accidents due to heavy usage or the way they are constructed. As a result, better street lights can be added (only protected left and right turns) or traffic personnel can be used to direct the cars. We want to analyze the accident “severity” in terms of human fatality, traffic delay, property damage, or any other type of accident bad impact so that advance warning and mitigation strategies can be developed based on insights of what avoidable reasons case these accidents.

The target audience of this analysis is the Seattle government and transportation department. It should identify key causes of accidents and allow them to identify trends for when accidents can be prevented. This will reduce the number of accidents and injuries for the city.
